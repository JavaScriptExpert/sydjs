Welcome!

SydJS has a site! And this is it. Feel free to hack. 

If you don't have membership access to the sydjs organisation on github yet, contact lachlanhardy or craigsharkie to get the hook up.

Otherwise, just fork it and send us a pull request!


More details will go below, but basically it's a simple Node app, using Express, running on Heroku.

We based the original deploy on atmos's awesome [heroku-express]: http://github.com/atmos/heroku-express
